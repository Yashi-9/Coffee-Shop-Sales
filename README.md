# Coffee-Shop-Sales
### Project Overview:
In this project, I analyzed a comprehensive dataset of over 149,000 transactions across multiple coffee shop locations. The goal was to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and boost profitability.

### Data analysis tool:
Microsoft Excel

### Analysis Observations:
1. Transaction Patterns (Weekdays vs. Weekends):
Weekday Sales: $503,587.54

Weekend Sales: $195,224.79

Weekend Sales Decrease: -61.2% compared to weekdays

Weekday Transactions: 107,510

Weekend Transactions: 41,606
3. Hourly Trends:
Peak Hour: 10 AM

Transactions During Peak Hour: 26,713

4. Category Analysis (Revenue Contribution):
   
Coffee: $269,952.45 (38.63% of total revenue)

Tea: $196,405.95 (28.11%)

Bakery: $82,315.64 (11.78%)

Other categories (e.g., Drinking Chocolate, Coffee Beans) contribute less than 10% each.
6. Store Performance:

Top-Performing Store: Hell's Kitchen ,with $236,511.17 in sales

Lowest-Performing Store: Lower Manhattan, with $230,057.25 in sales.
7. Purchase Sizes:

Regular Size has the highest Contribution: 31% of all transactions.

### Conclusion of the Analysis:
1.   Weekend Sales Opportunity:
While weekday sales dominate, the significant drop in weekend sales (-61.2%) suggests untapped potential. Tailored weekend promotions or events could boost footfall and revenue.
2. Peak Hour Optimization:
With 10 AM being the busiest hour, contributing over 26,713 transactions, focusing marketing efforts and operational resources during this time can maximize revenue.
3.  Product Prioritization:
Coffee (38.63%) and Tea (28.11%) are the main revenue drivers.
Bakery items (11.78%) present opportunities for cross-selling with beverages.
Lesser-performing categories like Flavours (1.2%) and Packaged Chocolate (0.63%) may need repositioning or strategic discontinuation.
4. Store-Level Insights:
The top-performing store achieved nearly $236,511.17 in sales , while the lowest-performing store lagged at $230,057.25. Custom strategies for low-performing locationsâ€”such as local marketing, operational enhancements, or new product introductions could help bring in footfall and revenue.
5. Upselling Opportunity in Small Sizes:
Despite contributing only 9% of all transactions, small-sized purchases hold significant revenue potential. Upselling strategies and promotions targeting these items could increase their share.

### Recommendation:
1. Leverage peak sales hours (10 AM) and weekday dominance for focused marketing campaigns.
Introduce weekend-specific offers to capitalize on untapped traffic.
2. Optimize underperforming categories or reposition them with promotions to improve their contribution.
3. Invest in upselling and combo deals for small-sized products to boost overall revenue.
